# tasklist

This is just a basic tasklist made with Javascript and HTML.  Materialize and some JQuery were used in setting up the styling. I know it isn't anything crazy cool, but I wanted to do a few small projects in vanilla JS.  

For running the program, I have used VSCode to open the folder and run through Live Server.  You can also download the folder, go into your browser, and choose Open File and select the index.html file in the Tasklist folder you have downloaded.
